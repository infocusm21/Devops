Nice! You're aiming for **advanced control** — storing container images used by Minikube in a **custom directory** is definitely doable but depends on the **container runtime and driver** Minikube is using.

Let’s break it down and guide you to get this done:

---

## 🔍 First: Check Minikube Driver & Runtime

Run this:
```bash
minikube profile list
minikube config view
```

And:
```bash
minikube ssh docker info    # if you're using Docker driver
```

You'll usually see either:

- **Docker**
- **containerd**
- **VirtualBox**
- **KVM2**

Let me know which one you're on.

## ✅ Option 1: Use Docker & Store Images in Custom Directory

If you're using the **Docker driver**, Docker stores images in:
```
/var/lib/docker
```

To change it to a **custom path** (example: `/mnt/my-docker-store`):

1. Stop Minikube:
```bash
minikube stop
```

2. Configure Docker in Minikube to use custom directory:
```bash
minikube ssh
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/my-docker-store
sudo systemctl stop docker
```

3. Edit the Docker service config:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/docker/daemon.json
```

Add or update:
```json
{
  "data-root": "/mnt/my-docker-store"
}
```

4. Restart Docker:
```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reexec
sudo systemctl start docker
exit
```

5. Start Minikube again:
```bash
minikube start
```

Now Docker inside Minikube stores all pulled images in your custom path!

---

## ✅ Option 2: Set Custom Minikube Home

You can also move the **whole Minikube environment** (config, cache, images, clusters, etc.):

```bash
export MINIKUBE_HOME=$HOME/my-minikube-data
minikube start
```

To make this permanent:
```bash
echo 'export MINIKUBE_HOME=$HOME/my-minikube-data' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

## 🧪 Want me to generate full steps based on your driver?

Just tell me:
```bash
minikube config get driver
```

And I’ll give you **customized instructions**!
