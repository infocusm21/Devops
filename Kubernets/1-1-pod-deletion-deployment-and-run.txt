Great question — and the answer depends on **how** the pod was created.

---

## 🧨 If You Created the Pod with `kubectl run my-nginx-pod --image=nginx`

This creates a **standalone Pod**, not managed by a Deployment.  
So when you delete it:

```bash
kubectl delete pod my-nginx-pod
```

👉 **It is gone forever. It does NOT auto-recreate.**

---

## ✅ If You Created the Pod via a **Deployment**

For example:

```bash
kubectl create deployment demo-app --image=nginx
```

This creates:
- A **Deployment** object that manages a **ReplicaSet**
- The ReplicaSet ensures that a certain number of Pods are always running

If you now run:

```bash
kubectl get pods
kubectl delete pod demo-app-xxxxx
```

🔥 Kubernetes will **immediately recreate** that pod automatically to maintain the desired state (replica count = 1 by default).

### 🧠 Why It Shows Initial Setup?

Yes — when a Pod is recreated, the container image (like `nginx`) starts fresh from its original state. Any data **not saved to a persistent volume** is lost.

> This is why we use **Volumes** if we need data persistence.

### ✅ Summary

| Created With                | Auto-Recreate Pod? | Starts Fresh (Like New Container)? |
|----------------------------|--------------------|-------------------------------------|
| `kubectl run` (just a Pod) | ❌ No              | ✅ Yes                               |
| `kubectl create deployment`| ✅ Yes             | ✅ Yes                               |

Let me know if you want to move into **Deployments**, **ReplicaSets**, or **Volumes** next!
