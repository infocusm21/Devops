Sure! Here's how you can **completely uninstall Minikube** from your Ubuntu system 🔧:

---

## 🧼 **Step-by-Step: Uninstall Minikube on Ubuntu**

### ✅ 1. **Stop Minikube (if running)**
```bash
minikube stop
```

### ✅ 2. **Delete the Minikube Cluster**
```bash
minikube delete
```

### ✅ 3. **Remove Minikube Binary**
If installed via direct download or script:
```bash
sudo rm -f /usr/local/bin/minikube
```

If installed via `snap`:
```bash
sudo snap remove minikube
```

### ✅ 4. **Remove Minikube Config and Data**
```bash
rm -rf ~/.minikube
rm -rf ~/.kube
```

> ⚠️ `~/.kube` might also contain configs for other clusters — only remove it if you're sure.

---

### ✅ 5. **Optional: Remove `kubectl` if you installed it just for Minikube**
If you want to remove `kubectl` too:
```bash
sudo rm -f /usr/local/bin/kubectl
```
Or, if installed via `snap`:
```bash
sudo snap remove kubectl
```

---

## ✅ Done!
Now Minikube is completely removed from your Ubuntu system 🎉
