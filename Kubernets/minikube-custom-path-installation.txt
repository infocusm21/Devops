Got it! If you want to install **Minikube** in a **custom directory** instead of the default `/usr/local/bin`, here's how to do it:

---

## âœ… Install Minikube to a Custom Directory

### ðŸ”§ Step-by-step:

```bash
# Step 1: Download the Minikube binary
curl -LO https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/releases/latest/download/minikube-linux-amd64

# Step 2: Choose your custom directory (example: $HOME/my-tools)
mkdir -p $HOME/my-tools

# Step 3: Move and rename the binary
mv minikube-linux-amd64 $HOME/my-tools/minikube

# Step 4: Make it executable
chmod +x $HOME/my-tools/minikube

# Step 5: (Optional but recommended) Add it to your PATH
echo 'export PATH=$HOME/my-tools:$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

---

### âœ… Test it:
```bash
minikube version
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see the version info.

Let me know your custom path if you want me to tailor the commands exactly for your folder.
