You're almost there — great question! Let’s clarify how **Minikube works with custom paths** and where it **stores images and data**:

---

## ✅ Yes: Minikube Binary in Custom Path

You're running the `minikube` binary from your **custom path**, so ✅ that part is working as expected.

---

## 🗂️ But: Minikube's Storage (Images, Clusters, etc.)

By default, **Minikube stores pulled images, cluster data, and volumes in:**
```
~/.minikube/
```

Even if your binary is in a custom folder, Minikube **still uses this default path** unless you override it.

---

## 🎯 If You Want to Change the Storage Location

You can customize where Minikube stores its data using the `--profile` and `--root` options **or** by setting environment variables.

### ✅ Option 1: Use `MINIKUBE_HOME`
This changes where Minikube stores its internal files:
```bash
export MINIKUBE_HOME=$HOME/my-minikube-data
minikube start
```

It will now create:
```
$HOME/my-minikube-data/
├── cache/
├── machines/
├── profiles/
└── ...
```

### ✅ Option 2: Use a custom driver storage (like a custom disk)
If you're using the Docker driver:
- Docker will store images in its own storage location (`/var/lib/docker`) unless Docker itself is configured to store somewhere else.

---

## 💡 Summary:

| Feature | Customizable? | Default |
|--------|----------------|---------|
| `minikube` binary location | ✅ Yes | `/usr/local/bin/minikube` |
| Minikube data (images, config) | ✅ Yes (`MINIKUBE_HOME`) | `~/.minikube/` |
| Docker image storage | ✅ Yes (via Docker config) | `/var/lib/docker` |

---

If you want, I can guide you through:
- Setting `MINIKUBE_HOME` permanently
- Pointing Minikube to a different disk or mount
- Or configuring Docker to use a custom image directory
