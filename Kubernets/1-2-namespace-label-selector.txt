Perfect! Let’s go step-by-step. Since you’ve already got a good grasp on **Pods, Nodes, Deployments, kubelet, etc.**, let’s dive into the next key topics in order.

---

## 🧱 1. **Namespaces, Labels, and Selectors** (Foundations for organizing everything)

---

### 📂 **Namespaces** – Think of them like folders to separate environments or teams.

```bash
kubectl get namespaces
```

Common ones:
- `default` – where everything goes unless you specify otherwise
- `kube-system` – Kubernetes internal components
- `kube-public` – readable by everyone (usually not used)
- `kube-node-lease` – for heartbeats from nodes

✅ Create a new namespace:
```bash
kubectl create namespace dev
```

✅ Deploy something in that namespace:
```bash
kubectl create deployment nginx --image=nginx --namespace=dev
```

✅ View resources in a namespace:
```bash
kubectl get pods -n dev
```

---

### 🏷️ **Labels & Selectors** – Help Kubernetes identify and group resources.

Add labels:
```bash
kubectl label pod nginx-abc123 app=frontend env=dev
```

Find resources with specific labels:
```bash
kubectl get pods -l app=frontend
```

Used by:
- Services (to find pods)
- Deployments (to manage pods)
- NetworkPolicies
- Autoscalers

Would you like a quick hands-on lab where we:
1. Create a namespace  
2. Deploy a labeled app  
3. Create a Service that uses a selector to connect to the pod?

Or should we move to the next topic: **ConfigMaps & Secrets**?
