➊ 𝐅𝐨𝐮𝐧𝐝𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐒𝐞𝐫𝐯𝐢𝐜𝐞𝐬 (𝐄𝐬𝐬𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐢𝐚𝐥 𝐟𝐨𝐫 𝐂𝐥𝐨𝐮𝐝 𝐁𝐚𝐬𝐢𝐜𝐬)
These services provide the backbone for security, monitoring, and resource management:

↳ IAM (Identity and Access Management): Role-based access control for users, services, and resources

↳ CloudWatch: For logging, monitoring metrics, and setting alerts for cloud resources

↳ CloudTrail: Tracks user activity and API calls for auditing and compliance

↳ VPC (Virtual Private Cloud): Configures secure networks for cloud resources

↳ CloudFormation/Terraform: Automates resource provisioning using Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

➋ 𝐂𝐨𝐫𝐞 𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚 𝐄𝐧𝐠𝐢𝐧𝐞𝐞𝐫𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐒𝐞𝐫𝐯𝐢𝐜𝐞𝐬
These services are essential for managing, processing, and analyzing data:

↳ S3 (Simple Storage Service): A scalable storage solution for structured and unstructured data

↳ Glue: A serverless ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) service to prepare and transform data

↳ Lambda: A serverless compute service to run code in response to events

↳ RDS (Relational Database Service): Managed relational databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server

↳ DynamoDB: A NoSQL database for key-value and document-based workloads

↳ Redshift: A fully managed data warehouse for large-scale analytics

↳ Athena: Query data in S3 using SQL without the need for servers

↳ Kinesis: Processes real-time data streams for analytics and applications

↳ EMR (Elastic MapReduce): Processes large datasets using frameworks like Hadoop and Spark

↳ Step Functions: Coordinates workflows for serverless applications and data pipelines

↳ Data Pipeline: Orchestrates data movement and transformation across services

↳ Elasticsearch/OpenSearch: Enables fast and scalable search and analytics for logs and data

➌ 𝐀𝐝𝐝𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐚𝐥 𝐔𝐬𝐞𝐟𝐮𝐥 𝐒𝐞𝐫𝐯𝐢𝐜𝐞𝐬
While not core, these services complement and enhance data engineering workflows:

↳ SNS (Simple Notification Service): Sends notifications and alerts based on events

↳ SQS (Simple Queue Service): Manages message queues for asynchronous processing

↳ API Gateway: Deploys APIs to interact with other services or applications

↳ Secrets Manager/Parameter Store: Securely stores and retrieves sensitive information like database credentials

↳ SageMaker: Builds, trains, and deploys machine learning models

Focus on one service at a time to build confidence, and start creating projects to showcase your skills!
