It looks like you want to create a systemd service, but there are inconsistencies in the service name and the application being started. Based on your inputs, I'll assume you want to create a service for **PyCharm Community Edition**. Hereâ€™s the corrected systemd service file:


cat /etc/systemd/system/pychram.service

### **PyCharm systemd Service File**
```ini

[Unit]
Description=PyCharm Community Edition Service
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=/opt/pycharm-community-2024.3.4/bin/pycharm.sh
User=harish
Restart=on-failure
Environment=DISPLAY=:0
Environment=XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/run/user/1000

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

EOT

```
### **Commands to Enable & Start the Service:**
```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable pycharm.service
sudo systemctl start pycharm.service
```


To create a desktop icon----------------------------------------------------------

Glad it's working! Now, to make PyCharm appear in the application search menu with an icon, you need to create a **desktop entry** for it.

### **Step 1: Create the Desktop Entry**
Run the following command to open a new `.desktop` file in a text editor:


```bash
nano ~/.local/share/applications/pycharm.desktop
```


(If you want it available system-wide, use `/usr/share/applications/pycharm.desktop` instead.)

### **Step 2: Add the Following Content**
```ini


[Desktop Entry]
Version=1.0
Type=Application
Name=PyCharm Community
Icon=/opt/pycharm-community-2024.3.4/bin/pycharm.svg
Exec=/opt/pycharm-community-2024.3.4/bin/pycharm.sh
Categories=Development;IDE;
Terminal=false
StartupWMClass=jetbrains-pycharm
```


### **Step 3: Make It Executable**


```bash
chmod +x ~/.local/share/applications/pycharm.desktop
```

### **Step 4: Update Desktop Database**


```bash
update-desktop-database ~/.local/share/applications/
```

Now, restart your system or log out and log back in. PyCharm should appear in your search menu with the correct icon! ðŸŽ‰
